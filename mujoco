# mujoco : How to get started fast

Introduction:  
What is mujoco?  
Mujoco is a free and open-source physics engine commonly used in Robotics. Mujoco has fast and accurate simulations.  
It is designed for model-based optimisation, especially for contact-rich tasks.  
Mujoco also has in-built testing and validation mechanisms.  

Relevant Features (to the author) :  
* Avoids joint violations
* Inverse dynamics are well-defined in presence of contacts
* solvers : newton, conjugate gradient
* Friction cones: Pyramidal, elliptic
* Simulates cloths, ropes, soft object 
* Continuous-time formulation of constraints via convex optimisation
* GUI : available

Installation:  
The easiest way is to run `pip install mujoco`. Preferrably do this with a conda environment (as you should already know).
